# WorldBuilderProject

This is a Image-based map generation tool developed for a university module.
It takes in an image from a path specified in the settings file, and generates a biome map (based on height and water distribution)
in accordance with other settings.

A grey screen will appear while the image processes, before the world is shown and additionally saved to file (in the format "[original file name]World.jpg")
It will save over the same file each time, so re-name any you particularly like to keep them.

Whilst great pains were taken to make sure everything is bug free, if anything *DOES* crash, it's usually down to some of the settings not playing nicelytogether - try tweaking a few things.
